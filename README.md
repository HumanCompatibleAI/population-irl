# population-irl
(Experimental) Inverse reinforcement learning from trajectories generated by multiple agents with different (but correlated) rewards

## Installation

I use Anaconda for dependencies, you can create an environment with the prerequisite dependencies by running:
	
	conda env create name pirl
	source activate pirl
	pip install git+git://github.com/AdamGleave/rllab.git
	pip install git+git://github.com/AdamGleave/inverse_rl.git
	conda env update --name pirl --file environment.yml 

There are some binary libraries that some Python packages required that are not in Conda. On Ubuntu you can install the necessary dependencies by:
  sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libopenmpi-dev 

Alternately, if you wish to configure your own container, the dependencies are RLLab, Python 3, NumPy, PyTorch and OpenAI Gym.

## Usage

To check everything works, you can run:

	python -m pirl.experiments.cli dummy-test
